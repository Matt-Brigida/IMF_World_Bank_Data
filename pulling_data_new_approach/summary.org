Below is a summary of each variable and its source and description.

|-------------------+--------+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Inflation         | IMF    | PCPI_PC_CP_A_PT | Prices, Consumer Price Index, All items, Percentage change, Corresponding period previous year, Percent |
| Unemployment Rate | IMF    | LUR_PT          | Labor Markets, Unemployment Rate, Percent                                                               |

** World Bank Data


** IMF Data



* Data Set Construction


** Mentions

#+begin_src R :session :results output :exports both 
mentions <- read.csv("./raw_exp.txt", stringsAsFactors=FALSE, header=TRUE)
mentions$Topic <- gsub(",", "", mentions$Topic)
names(mentions)[1]  <- "Country"

## calculate % mentions for each topic by country/year group------

mentions <- mentions %>%
    group_by(Country, Year) %>%
    mutate(lhs = Mentions / sum(Mentions))

## make sure each row is unique----

mentionsIndex <- paste0(mentions$Country, "_", mentions$Year)
mentionsIndex <- gsub(" ", "", mentionsIndex)

mentions <- cbind(mentionsIndex, data.frame(mentions))

### Merge with IMF/WB Data

econ_vars_for_model <- econ[, c("country", "year", vars)]

## now need to extract only unique country and year subsets-----

econVarsIndex <- paste0(econ_vars_for_model$country, "_", econ_vars_for_model$year)

econ_vars_for_model <- cbind(econVarsIndex, econ_vars_for_model)

econ_vars_for_model <- subset(econ_vars_for_model, !duplicated(econ_vars_for_model$econVarsIndex))

#### Join data-----

mergedMentions <- merge(mentions, econ_vars_for_model, by.x = "mentionsIndex", by.y = "econVarsIndex")

mergedMentions <- mergedMentions[, c("Country", "Year", "Mentions", "lhs", vars)]

### mergedMentionsED <- mergedMentionsED[complete.cases(mergedMentionsED), ]

## convert to plm
#### mergedMentionsED_p <- pdata.frame(mergedMentionsED, index = c("Country", "Year"), drop.index=FALSE, row.names=TRUE)

write.csv(mergedMentions, "merged_metions.csv")
